\section{Introduction}
Welcome to the latest release of Gummi - the simple {\LaTeX} editor. After a long break in development, we're finally back with version 0.8.0.\\
With this release we say farewell to GTK2 and mark the beginning of the use of the GTK3 toolkit within our codebase; a migration arguably long overdue but now complete. 

\section{Contributing}
If you would like to contribute to this project, we'd appreciate it very much. Please refer to the \emph{Getting Involved}\footnote{https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi/wiki/Getting-Involved} section on our wiki for more information. 

\section{What's next}

Within the 0.8.x release series we will focus on fixing bugs. New functionality will be integrated into the next major release. For an overview of currently accepted features, please check the 0.9.0 milestone\footnote{https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi/milestone/3}.

\section{In closing}
We hope you will enjoy using this release as much as we enjoyed creating it. If you have any further comments, suggestions or wish to report an issue, please visit \emph{\textbf{https://gummi.app}}.
